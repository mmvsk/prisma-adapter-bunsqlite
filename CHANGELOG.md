## [0.6.3] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- **Explicit configuration for `unixepoch-ms` timestamp format** - When using `timestampFormat: "unixepoch-ms"`, you must now explicitly choose one of three workarounds for the DateTime aggregate limitation:
  - `safeIntegers: false` - Disables BigInt, all integers are JS numbers (ensure values stay within safe range)
  - `allowBigIntToNumberConversion: true` - Converts BigInts in timestamp range to numbers (fixes aggregates, mixed return types)
  - `allowUnsafeDateTimeAggregates: true` - Accepts that `_min`/`_max` on DateTime return `Invalid Date` (matches `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`)

- **Configuration validation** - Using `timestampFormat: "unixepoch-ms"` without one of the above options now throws a descriptive error at adapter creation, forcing explicit acknowledgment of the trade-off.

### Changed

- Updated README with detailed documentation about timestamp format options, the aggregate limitation, and all three workarounds with their trade-offs.

### Compatibility

- 147 tests passing (10 new tests: 9 configuration validation + 1 DateTime aggregate fix)
- Supports Prisma 7.0.0+ and Bun 1.3.3+

### Thanks

- Thanks to [@crishoj](https://github.com/crishoj) for documenting the DateTime aggregate limitation in PR #2

---

## [0.6.2] - 2025-12-08

### Changed

- Updated peer/dependency version ranges to `^7.0.0` (was `^7.1.0`) to avoid warnings for users on Prisma 7.0.x
- Updated lockfile to Prisma 7.1.0 and Bun 1.3.4

### Compatibility

- Tested with Bun 1.3.4 (SQLite 3.51.1) - all 137 tests passing
- Supports Prisma 7.0.0+ and Bun 1.3.3+

---

## [0.6.1] - 2025-11-26

### Changed

- Updated package.json typescript version selector, and bun-types version in bun.lock

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-26

### Breaking Changes

- **BREAKING**: Minimum Bun version increased to **1.3.3** (was 1.3.0)
  - This simplifies the codebase by removing compatibility code for older Bun versions
  - Bun 1.3.3+ changed statement metadata access to require execution first

- **BREAKING**: `lastInsertId` is no longer returned for INSERT queries without RETURNING
  - This was a feature beyond the official adapter's capabilities
  - The official `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3` also doesn't return `lastInsertId`
  - **Migration**: Use `INSERT...RETURNING id` to get the inserted ID

### Fixed

- **Type Inference** - Fixed `inferTypeFromValue()` to return `UnknownNumber` for numeric values (matching official better-sqlite3 adapter). Previously returned `Int32` or `Double` based on `Number.isInteger()`, which could cause incorrect type handling.

- **Transaction Safety** - Improved error handling in `startTransaction()` to rollback the transaction if the transaction object constructor fails after `BEGIN`.

- **Dispose Safety** - `dispose()` now waits for any active transaction to complete before closing the database, preventing potential data corruption.

- **Error Handling** - Unrecognized errors are now wrapped in `GenericJs` error format instead of being re-thrown. This provides consistent error handling for both SQLite errors and internal bugs.

### Added

- **PRAGMA Validation** - Runtime validation for WAL configuration values:
  - `synchronous` must be one of: OFF, NORMAL, FULL, EXTRA
  - `walAutocheckpoint` must be a non-negative integer
  - `busyTimeout` must be a non-negative integer
  - Invalid values now throw descriptive errors instead of potentially corrupting configuration

- **Mutex Queue Size Limit** - `AsyncMutex` now has a configurable queue size limit (default: 1000) to prevent unbounded memory growth under extreme concurrency. Throws a descriptive error when the queue is full.

### Changed

- **Simplified Codebase** - Removed Bun < 1.3.3 compatibility code from `queryRaw()`. Now uses the Bun 1.3.3+ pattern of getting metadata after execution.

- **135 tests** (was 136) - Removed `lastInsertId` test since feature is no longer supported

### Technical Details

- Code reviewed by Claude Opus 4.5 for bugs, improvements, and alignment with official Prisma better-sqlite3 adapter
- Codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable with consistent Bun 1.3.3+ patterns

---

## [0.5.6] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed

- **Bun 1.3.3 Compatibility** - Fixed breaking change in Bun 1.3.3+ where `stmt.declaredTypes` and `stmt.columnNames` require execution before access. The adapter now handles both pre-execution (Bun < 1.3.0) and post-execution (Bun 1.3.3+) metadata access patterns.
- **Pragma Query Type Inference** - Fixed incorrect type detection for pragma queries (e.g., `PRAGMA journal_mode`) where `columnTypes` throws "not available for non-read-only statements". The adapter now falls back to value-based type inference when metadata is unavailable, correctly detecting text values instead of defaulting to Int32.

### Added

- **Value-based Type Inference** - New `inferTypeFromValue()` function in `conversion.ts` to infer column types from actual values when both `declaredTypes` and `runtimeTypes` are unavailable (used for pragmas and edge cases in Bun 1.3.3+).

### Technical Details

- Enhanced `queryRaw()` to wrap metadata access in try-catch and retrieve metadata after execution if pre-execution access fails
- Updated `getColumnTypes()` to accept optional `values` parameter for type inference fallback
- All 136 tests continue to pass with both Bun 1.3.3 and earlier versions

---

## [0.5.5] - 2025-11-24

### Changed

- **Column Type Detection** - Now uses Bun's official `stmt.columnTypes` API ([oven-sh/bun#20232](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/20232), Bun 1.2.17+) for runtime type detection on computed columns (COUNT, LENGTH, expressions), replacing value-based inference
- **Type Safety** - Removed `(stmt as any)` casts for `columnNames`, `declaredTypes`, and `values()` - now properly typed

### Added

- **5 new tests** for runtime column type detection (136 total)
  - Computed columns (COUNT, LENGTH, arithmetic expressions)
  - Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
  - INSERT...RETURNING graceful fallback
  - Declared types priority over runtime types
  - Mixed declared and computed columns

### Documentation

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Documented column type detection system with API table
- **CLAUDE.md** - Added `bun tsc --noEmit` to development workflow

---

---

## [0.5.1] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed

- **Documentation** - Corrected version badges and requirements (Bun 1.3+, Prisma 7.0+)

---

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-23

### Changed

- **Modular File Structure** - Split single 1012-line `adapter.ts` into 8 focused modules:
  - `types.ts` - Type definitions
  - `errors.ts` - Error mapping
  - `conversion.ts` - Type conversions
  - `queryable.ts` - Base queryable class
  - `transaction.ts` - Transaction + AsyncMutex
  - `adapter.ts` - Main adapter class
  - `factory.ts` - Factory class
  - `migration.ts` - Migration utilities (renamed from `migrations.ts`)

- **Always Coerce Argument Types** - Removed fast-path optimization that skipped `mapArg` for non-datetime/bytes/boolean types. Correctness over micro-optimization.

- **Robust Column Metadata Handling** - Improved sync between `columnNames`, `declaredTypes`, and actual row data for edge cases.

### Added

- **131 Tests** - Up from 90, including 40 official Prisma scenarios ported from `prisma-engines/quaint`
- **lastInsertId Support** - Now returned for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements (matches libsql adapter)
- **useTransaction Option** - For programmatic migrations with BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK

### Documentation

- Complete README rewrite - cleaner structure, reliability-first messaging
- Simplified ARCHITECTURE.md - focused on key implementation details
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new file structure

---

## [0.4.3] - 2025-11-21

### Performance

- **Fast-Path Argument Passthrough** ⚡
  - Skip `.map()` when no datetime/bytes/boolean conversion needed
  - Eliminates array allocation and type checking overhead for simple queries
  - Expected improvement: 20-40% faster on write-heavy workloads with primitive types
  - Targets the 2.8× gap on "Create single user" benchmark

---

## [0.4.2] - 2025-11-21

### Performance

- **CRITICAL: Statement Caching** 🚀
  - Changed from `db.prepare()` to `db.query()` which caches compiled SQL statements
  - Root cause: `db.prepare()` recompiles SQL on every call, `db.query()` caches internally
  - Expected improvement: 2-6× faster on tmpfs/in-memory workloads (pending benchmark)
  - On SSD: minimal difference (disk I/O dominates)

---

## [0.4.1] - 2025-11-21

### Changed

- **Code Simplification & Optimization**
  - Removed `needsMapping` conditional checks in queryRaw/executeRaw for cleaner code
  - Cached `timestampFormat` at class level to eliminate repeated lookups
  - Simplified `mapArg()` signature to accept timestampFormat directly
  - Removed global flag from regex pattern (micro-optimization)
  - ISO 8601 timestamps now use `Z` suffix instead of `+00:00` (both valid, simpler)

### Documentation

- **Fixed Prisma 7 Import Patterns**
  - Corrected import statements to use generated client: `import { PrismaClient } from "./prisma/generated/client"`
  - Fixed `prisma.config.ts` to use `env()` helper for datasource URL
  - Updated schema examples to use correct relative output path

---

## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-21

### Changed

- **Transaction Handling** ⚡
  - Changed `usePhantomQuery: true` → `false` (matches official `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`)
  - Simplified commit/rollback methods to only release mutex lock
  - Prisma engine now sends COMMIT/ROLLBACK SQL through executeRaw() for cleaner lifecycle
  - Removed `BEGIN DEFERRED` → `BEGIN` for standard transaction start

### Added

- **Production-Ready WAL Configuration** 🚀
  - Added comprehensive `WalConfiguration` type with advanced options
  - `synchronous` mode: OFF/NORMAL/FULL/EXTRA (2-3x performance difference)
  - `walAutocheckpoint`: Control checkpoint frequency for write-heavy workloads
  - `busyTimeout`: Configurable lock timeout (default 5000ms)
  - WAL now opt-in (not enabled by default) for better defaults
  - Gracefully handles `:memory:` databases (WAL not supported)

- **Enhanced Type Support** 📊
  - **UNSIGNED integer types**: `TINYINT UNSIGNED`, `SMALLINT UNSIGNED`, `MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED`, `INT UNSIGNED`, `INTEGER UNSIGNED`, `BIGINT UNSIGNED`
    - Fixes type warnings for Prisma's `_prisma_migrations` table (`INTEGER UNSIGNED`)
  - **VARCHAR/CHAR length specifiers**: Now handles `VARCHAR(255)`, `CHAR(10)`, etc.
    - Strips length specifiers before type mapping: `VARCHAR(255)` → `VARCHAR`
  - **JSON type**: Added `JSON` alongside existing `JSONB` support
  - **CHAR type**: Added explicit `CHAR` type mapping to Text

### Testing

- **90 total tests** (up from 77)
- Added 13 comprehensive tests for new features:
  - 8 WAL configuration tests (enable/disable, advanced options, synchronous modes, shadow DB)

## [0.1.1] - 2024-11-20

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed data corruption when queries returned duplicate column names (common in JOINs)
  - Changed from `stmt.all()` (returns objects) to `stmt.values()` (returns arrays)
  - Objects lost duplicate keys (e.g., `User.id` and `Profile.id` both named `id`)
  - Arrays preserve all columns in correct order
  - Added regression test: `$queryRaw - preserves all columns in joins`

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed error mapping for errno-only errors
  - Bun SQLite sometimes returns `{ errno: 1, code: undefined }`
  - Added complete `SQLITE_ERROR_MAP` mapping 25+ error codes
  - Now properly handles missing table, syntax errors, etc.
